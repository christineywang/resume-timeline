# Christine's resume timeline

I am using the [Verum](https://onepagelove.com/verum) template from Template Wire.

I like material design.

For the splash photo, I am using a randomly generated [Josef Albers](http://billyroh.com/albers/) image.

I really liked the color scheme of the image so most of my website is using these colors (all shades of the same blue/green):
* Lightest: #aee6dd
* Medium: #62bfb4
* Dark: #3d7d79
* Darkest: #1f3634

For the fonts, I chose Courier New and Montserrat, my favorate old and new font combination.

The emojis are from [here](https://afeld.github.io/emoji-css/).
